# db-terminal

Write the same javascript code to execute CRUD operations on various regular and NoSQL databases. The module
currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB. But, there is an intention to include more databases.

To see a highlight of what can be achieved with this module, let us try to select all students who are named
<code>John</code> from <code>students</code> table. For this, we write the following statements. 

	PostgreSQL and MySQL:	select * from students where name='John';
		
	MongoDB:              db.students.find({ name: "John" })

To perform the same activity on any of the databases via this module, we use the following code:

```
			db.select({
				"table": "students",
				"where": "name='John'"
			});
```

# Installation

Using npm

```	$ npm install db-terminal --save```

Using yarn

```	$ yarn add db-terminal```

# Usage
To use this module, follow the procedures below:

1. Import:
	```const terminal = require('db-terminal');```
2. Instantiate the desired database:

	```
		const name = "postgresql"; // or "mysql" for MySQL, "mongodb" for MongoDB database
		const db = terminal(name);  
	```
	
3. Call the available functions
	The following functions can be called on the <code>db</code> instance created above. Calling any of
	these functions except the <code>connect</code> function is optional.

	+ connect (required)
	+ create
	+ insert
	+ select
	+ update
	+ delete
	+ query
	+ close (recommended)

	In addition to the above functions, the <code>db</code> instance has also the following property.
	
	+ commands

The description of the above functions and <code>command</code> property is given below. Although <code>collection</code> is the appropriate 
term which describes a collection of data in NoSQL databases, the term <code>table</code> will be used
for both of them. The properties of the arguments for each function are also explained where parameters 
within square brackets are optional. In addition, all the callback functions are called according to Node.js
standard where <code>err</code> is passed as the first argument and response data, if any, is passed as 
the second argument.

#### &#x1F537; connect(config :object [, callback :function]):

Example (database deletion)

```
			db.delete({"database": "items", item: "database"}, (err, res) => {
				if (err) {
					console.log("Error occured.");
					return;
				}
				console.log("Database deleted");
			});
```

				"truncate": true
			};

			db.delete(params, (err, res) => {
				if (err) {
					console.log("Error occured.");
					return;
				}
				console.log("Table truncated");
			});
```

Example (column deletion)

			});
```

#### &#x1F537; query(document :string |  |  object [, callback :function]): 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The advantage of the above functions is that they are database independent. You will use the same javascript code inspite of 
the database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ...) you use. However, they do not cover all possible database querries. However, there is still a back door offered by this module to execute any database query via this function. But, these querries are database specific.
And the developer should take this into consideration while using this function. The <code>document</code> argument is the database specific SQL statement (string) for regular databases or a query document (object) for noSQL databases.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In MongoDB, the <code>document</code> object should be constructed according to database commands stated in 
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/">this</a> official documentation. Apart from these specifications,
each document may also include additional <code>$db</code> key with a corresponding value of the name of the
database on which the database operations will be performed. If this property is not included, the database name specified
in the <code>config</code> parameter passed to the <code>connect</code> function will be used. See an example below.</p>

Example (PostgreSQL and MySQL)

```
			const sql = "select id from students except select ineligible_ids from programming";
			db.query(sql, (err, res) => {
				if (err) {
					console.log("Error occured.");
					return;
				}
				console.log(res);
			});
```

Example (MongoDB)
```
			const doc = { 
				find: "items", 
				$db: "sales", 
				projection: { _id: 0, price: 1, quantity: 1 }, 
				sort: { price: -1} 
			};

			db.query(doc, (err, res) => {
				if (err) {
					console.log("Error occured.");
					return;
				}
				console.log(res);
			});
```

#### &#x1F537; close(): 

<p style="text-align: justify;">This function closes the database connection.</p>

Example (MySQL or PostgreSQL)

```
			db.query("select * from customers", (err, res) => {
				if (err) {
					console.log("Error occured.");
					return;
				}
				console.log(res);
				db.close();
			});
```

#### &#x1F537; commands: 

<p style="text-align: justify;">This property contains the list of all commands (or status) of the executed operations. Each
element in the array contains an object with two properties - one for SQL and another for its NoSQL equivalent or vice versa.</p>

Example

```
			db.commands.forEach((command) => {
				console.log(command); // logs each command
			});	
```
 A sample <code>command</code> output for the above code may look like:

 ```
			{ sql:
			  	'UPDATE customers SET email = 'abc@def.com' , name = 'John Doe' WHERE id = 213',
			  nosql:
			    { 
			    	update: 'customers',
			      '$db': 'mydb',
			      ordered: false,
			      updates: [{ 
			        q: { id: 213 },  
			        u: { '$set': { email: 'abc@def.com', name: 'John Doe' } },
							upsert: true,
							multi: true 
						}] 
			   	} 
			 }
 ```
